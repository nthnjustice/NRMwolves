            <p>The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) is arguably the most important conservation law in the history of the United States. Since it’s passage, the law has helped protect hundreds of species from inevitable extinction. One iconic and equally controversial species the ESA has helped protect is the gray wolf. Historically gray wolves were abundant throughout the contiguous United States but starting in the early 20th century their numbers began to drastically decline due to over hunting and habitat loss. By 1960, the gray wolf was completely extirpated from all of the United States except for Alaska and northern Minnesota.</p>
            <p>Wolves were one of the first species included in the ESA’s protection. Since then, their population has experienced remarkable growth in the northern Rocky Mountains (NRM). The interactive graphs below highlight this phenomenon. The data is sourced from the United States Department of the Interior (DOI) and represents an annual census of wolves in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, and Wyoming from 1982 to 2012. The recorded numbers are actual counts of unique individuals observed by DOI biologists on federally owned land and not broad population estimates for each state.</p>
            <p>It is easy to ascertain that wolves are experiencing a dramatic recovery in each of the states featured below - including a nearly exponential growth in the total NRM population up until the final year on record. Additionally, it can be observed that since re-establishment, wolves in Idaho have experienced the most rapid population recovery.</p>
